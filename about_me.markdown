Hello!

My name is Alexander Lorei. I am a sophomore in highschool with a large interest in cyber security. Currently I am in the process of creating a CTF team in my school, I will be training the kids, most of which have never done any cyber security related things before. I am also networking and trying to start my job search early before I graduate highschool for optimal performance in the job world.
